So I really want a 9070XT or a 5070Ti. But I only want to spend $750!!

So I made this script to send me a text message when one is in stock.

To get the messages working you must create a file called message_info, and in that file put:
phone_number = {Your number}
provider = {Your cell phone provider}
sender_credentials = ({Your gmail}, {One time generated google password})

Run the stock_status python file and enjoy!
